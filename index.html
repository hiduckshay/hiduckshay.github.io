            Hi! I'm Akshay, pronounced duck-shay without the d. Hence my username, hiduckshay! I'm a second year MSHCDE student. I grew up in India but have been hopping bases since I was 18. Before moving to Seattle, I lived in San Francisco. This summer I got the opportunity to intern in NYC, study abroad in London, and travel to Budapest, New Delhi, and Charleston. I'm in Virginia wearing traditional Indian clothing an hour before two of my best friends' wedding as I hastily type this homework (so if something doesn't make sense, that's probably my bad!).

            I've been fanboying Dr. Peek's past work and Ted Talks for MONTHS so just being in this class is such a cool exeprience. That said, I'm also a big fan of design thinking in the third dimmension (something we don't often get to exeprience in HCDE). During the 3 weeks of my study abroad in London, we got the chance to experiment a lot with physical products and it pumped me even more for this class because we'll get to design and create products in the third dimmension.

            <p>
            I think it takes a completely different part of your brain to create design solutions in the third dimmension and it's a part of my brain I haven't been able to access since the summer of 2015 when I took an industrial design studio in my undergrad. I'm excited to work with all the machines and create physical artifacts that best capture the random ideas that pop up in my head.

            I'm a younger sibling and thus, prone to always looking up to my peers for advice, critique, and ideas for improvement. That said, I'm looking returning the favor in any way I can in this class. It seemed like a lot of us were struggling with the technical side of things on the first day a bit so I'm looking forward to struggling and solidarity and also to tackling roadblocks together with my peers in this class.
