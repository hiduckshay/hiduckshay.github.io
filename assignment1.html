            The inspiration for this assignmet comes from my love for Coldplay! The album art for one of their albums uses this circle of life that I've always found really beautiful. While is a 2 dimmensional shape, I wanted to see how playing with circles 3 dimensionally might look like.

            <p>
            I started out by drawing a circle with a 5cm diameter, with four diametrically opposite 1cm trims rectangular trims ~1.7mm in width (which I derived by measuring the thickness of my recycled piece of cardboard).

            I haven't yet been able to laser cut my designs because one of the laser cutters was reserved and the other down for maintenance. I still hope to be able to make the cut outs today before class (but in case I can't, I will be back tomorrow!).
