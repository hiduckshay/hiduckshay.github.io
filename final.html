              First thing you need to know about me is that I LOVE Coldplay. In the last year, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to see them live 3 times ‚Äì in Seattle, San Francisco, and London! I love how energetic and colorful their concerts are. I wanted to combine this expression of color and music into a speaker that has a light synced with the music.

              A few weeks ago when Prof Nadya pulled up IKEA and Teenage Engineering collab, I thought it‚Äôd be really cool to do build something just like this. I love the modularity and the simplicity of the design. If there‚Äôs anything I‚Äôve learnt from my recent 3D printing experiences it‚Äôs that I need to print modular designs with flatter parts.

              My poop candles turned out to be quite popular! And because I booked my 3D printer mold and just tore my silicone cast, I will need to make it again to fulfill the demand. And it would be cool to do it all again (if my printer doesn‚Äôt decide to be a üí© to me again). Maybe I‚Äôll do another shape, if it‚Äôs not okay to redo this assignment.
